  <h3 style="text-align:center; font-size: 30px; padding-top: 2%; color: #00F196;" >As a biology major, I have enjoyed working on many research projects.</h3>
  	<div>
	<p ID="indent">The first real research project I worked on was the summer between sophomore year and junior year called Project Limulus, working with the American horseshoe crabs, Limulus polyphemus. This study was done on the Long Island Sound, and I worked on three main beaches; Sandy Point, Milford Points, and Stratford Point. Myself and 4 other undergraduate students also at Sacred Heart worked under a few graduate students and two professors. We all tagged horseshoe crabs on these beaches and sometimes others, and also collected data on recaptures. We had to follow the tides during the full and moon every month, and you bet we were out there at 2am on the beach for a spawning survey to count how many horseshoe crabs were there! It was a really great experience!</p>

    <br />
    <p>Some things about the American Horseshoe crab you should really know:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>It's blood is blue and has a special compound in their amebocyste cell, which is like a super white blood cell. Every FDA approved drug needs to be tested with their blood to assure it is safe!</li>
		<li>It has a very important ecological component to it; there are at least 20 known species that grow and live on it including a parasite which is only found on the gills of a horseshoe crab!</li>
		<li>There is also an important economic value to the species because their meat is used in Asia for fishing. No, no one eats horseshoe crabs! </li>
        <li>It is called a 'living fossil' because it really hasn't evolved in 400 million years! (200 million years before dinosaurs existed!</li>
        <li>It can't harm you in any way; the tail is not a stinger, and is only used to flip itself over if needed.</li>
        <li>A female can lay up to 80,000 eggs at a time, and only about 12 will make it to adulthood.</li>
	</ol>
	</div>

<p id="bioParagraph">The following year I started my own independent research project with a professor at Sacred Heart, which he chose me to do it because it required knowledge and interest in both computer science and biology. I used a python-like script called MAC-CHYME to compare the DNA sequences of the sand in horseshoe crab nests and sand outside horseshoe crab nests. The process was very intricate and took a while because the files averaged at 60 KB! But when I completed it at the end of the school year, it was a great achievement for me. I presented the poster representing the results at Western Connecticut State University at the Sigma Xi conference, and at Sacred Heart University for the general academic research presentations. Check out the poster below!</p>
