    <p id="indent">	After graduating high school I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to do with my life. I knew that I was interested in science but wasn't quite sure what to do with that. So I chose biology as a major and decided to see where that would take me. Originally I wanted to go into the field of research because I wanted to make discoveries and be creative with my studies. However I learned by my sophomore year, maybe that wasn't quite my calling. I'm not sure if it was my decline of interest in my biology classes, or that fact that I broke two glass flasks in organic chemistry lab one day. Either or, I knew I needed to start taking courses in other subjects. Influenced by my genetics professor at the time, I registered for a computer science class thinking, hey why not. I aced introduction to structured programming without a struggle and from then on knew maybe biology wasn't for me, and maybe computer science was. Junior year I decided to minor in computer science, it being too late to switch my major. Even though It was considered a late decision, I'm glad I did. I now plan on a computer science career after I graduate and hoping to gain a masters a few years after working. While in undergraduate, here are the classes I have taken for computer science and biology.</p>
